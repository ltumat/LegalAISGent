# LegalAISGent

LegalAISGent is a project run by KTH AI Society in collaboration with ReGen Villages and James Ehrlich at Stanford University and Lawline.

Our goal is to make the permit application process for developing land as easy as possible.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```
## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

```bash
bun run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```
